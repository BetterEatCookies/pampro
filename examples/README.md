# PAMPRO examples

This examples section is very much a work in progress. The current intention is to provide a basic example analysis for one file from each supported device, and then provide a separate example to explain how to parallelise any analysis over a large dataset. In the future, all of these examples will be provided as IPython Notebooks (.ipynb files) which are much easier to follow.
