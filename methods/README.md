# Methods

The purpose of this section of the project is to provide transparent explanations and visualisations of some of the methods used in PAMPRO. Where appropriate we cite the relevant literature where the method originated.

## Diurnal regression for unbiased mean (unpublished)

Under the defensible assumption that missingness in objective physical activity data is structured, we model the daily pattern of a signal as a function of a sine and cosine wave with the wavelength of one day.
